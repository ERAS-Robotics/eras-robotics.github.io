      <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
        <p><b>The 1st International Conference on Engineering Reliable Autonomous Systems (ERAS)</b> will be held in Worcester, MA, USA from May 29 to May 30, 2025.</p> 
        <p>ERAS aims to offer a space for all stakeholders across autonomous system reliability to come together to discuss the key challenges and present progress made towards solving them. The scope of the conference is on all the aspects of engineering reliable autonomous systems, ranging from systems and software engineering to their verification and evaluation.  For the purpose of this conference, "autonomous systems" is synonymous with "systems that make their own decisions and can take their own actions," and includes everything from autonomous decision-making software running in a virtual environment to teams of autonomous robots operating in a distributed physical environment, everything from simple reactive systems with no planning capability to complex systems incorporating machine learning and reasoning engines. Contributions addressing aspects of reliability across the entire life cycle of the system are welcome.</p>
        <p> We invite submissions of original unpublished papers. All accepted (regular/short/position) papers will be published in the conference proceedings, under an ISBN reference, on IEEE Xplore.</p>

      <h2>Call for Workshops/Tutorials/Panels</h2>
      
            <p>At ERAS 2025, we plan to host a number of half-day workshops focusing on specific topics in the area of reliable autonomous systems. The workshops shall provide a platform for intense discussions of specific aspects of engineering autonomous systems and for starting discussions on new and emerging topics. We specifically welcome workshops that aim to bring together researchers and practitioners from different areas for lively discussions and exchange on novel and/or preliminary results from their communities to foster cross-community exchange. In addition to workshops, we also welcome relevant tutorial proposals that are specifically helpful for newcomers to the field.</p>


    
<p>We also solicit proposals for panels that shall provide a platform for discussion of 3-5 renowned experts from the field of engineering reliable autonomous systems on a topic that is of overarching interest to the ERAS target audience. Panels will be held as part of the main conference.</p>


<p>Please submit your workshop or panel proposal as a PDF file via email to <a href="mailto:eras.conference@gmail.com">eras.conference@gmail.com</a>.</p>
