      <h3>RAS CARES</h3>
      <p>IEEE Robotics and Automation Society strives to achieve the highest standards of integrity and endeavors to conduct business around the world in a responsible, ethical and sustainable way. It is important that those who act on the organization's behalf ensure RAS compliance by adhering to the same standards and expectations.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.ieee-ras.org/about-ras/diversity-page/ieee-ras-cares">IEEE RAS CARES</a> is a committee that acts as a trusted listener and empathetic support for the RAS community members around misconduct concerns, including, but not limited to sexual harassment, discrimination and bullying, at RAS conferences, workshops, meetings, and events. All IEEE RAS events abide by the <a href="https://www.ieee.org/content/dam/ieee-org/ieee/web/org/about/whatis/nondiscrimination.pdf">IEEE Policy Against Discrimination and Harassment</a> (PDF) and the <a href="https://www.ieee-ras.org/about-ras/diversity-page/ieee-ras-code-of-conduct">IEEE RAS Code of Conduct</a>. If a violation of this policy occurs, IEEE RAS encourages reporting the incident as described in the RAS Code of Conduct.</p>

      <h2>IEEE Diversity Statement</h2>
      <p>The organization is committed to fostering a culture that is diverse, inclusive, and equitable. In November 2019, the IEEE Board of Directors adopted a new diversity statement for incorporation into the IEEE policies:</p>
      <p><em>IEEE's mission to foster technological innovation and excellence to benefit humanity requires the talents and perspectives of people with different personal, cultural, and disciplinary backgrounds. IEEE is committed to advancing diversity in the technical profession, and to promoting an inclusive and equitable culture in its activities and programs that welcomes, engages and rewards those who contribute to the field without regard to race, religion, gender, disability, age, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.</em></p>
      <p>This change to the IEEE policy reflects IEEE's longstanding commitment to ensure the engineering profession maximizes its impact and success by welcoming, engaging, and rewarding those who contribute to the field in an equitable manner.</p>
